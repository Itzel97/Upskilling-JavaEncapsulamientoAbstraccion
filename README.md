# Upskilling-Java Encapsulation and Abstraction.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is binding the data members with member variables. This will avoid the direct access of variables, because direct access of variables may violate privacy, and hiding of the implementation will not be possible.
Encapsulation minimizes your code’s part revealed to the user. The user can be anyone who uses your published code or perhaps your code’s remaining part.

Encapsulation works like a protective wrapper that conceals the code and data within the class. That data and code will be accessed outside the method/member function and the class that is not the members of that class.
